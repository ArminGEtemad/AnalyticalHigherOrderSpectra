# Analytical calculations of higher order spectra
This code give you the analytical way to calculate
* Liouvilian of the system
* Steady State of the system
* turning measurement operators into superoperators


After these steps you are able to calculate the first order spectrum, second order as well as the third order spectrum.
The fourth order spectrum is not implemented due to very heavy calculation that is not feasible using Mathematica.
All the steps and how the algebraic calculations work are explained in the [pdf](https://github.com/ArminGEtemad/AnalyticalHigherOrderSpectra/blob/main/AnalyticalSpectraMultiDetectorNewSuperoperators.pdf).
The code is inspired by [this paper](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.98.205143) and was used as a contribution in DPG [here](https://www.dpg-verhandlungen.de/year/2025/conference/regensburg/part/hl/session/23/contribution/6).

A python library for it, can also be found [here](https://github.com/MarkusSifft/QuantumCatch).
